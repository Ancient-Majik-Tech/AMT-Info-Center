## Welcome

Welcome to the Projects Catagory System of AMT's Infomation Center. This system provides functionality to the info center by providing a guide of basic projects that are released to the public, along with some infomation about the given project.


### Project Catagories

Projects are broken up into different catagories to allow for orgnoziation of project development and user interaction.


#### CSharp Libraries

CSharp Libraries are Libraries that are developed with the Coding Language CSharp. They are also fully aligned with all AMT's [Design Layouts][Page DesignHome] to provide many advanced features.

They are also devided into 3 subtypes:

- [Realms Common Libraries][Sec CommonLibs]
- [Tool Libraries][Sec ToolLibs]
- [Tool UI Libraries][Sec ToolUILibs]

##### **Realms Common Libraries**

Realms Common Libraries are CSharp libraries which we build to help Users along with our own projects a stable and flexable set of features for use with tool development.

|Projects|Short Desc|
|:---|:---|
|[Realms Common Basics][Proj RCBasics]|This library provides many Trackers and Versioning basics|
|[Realms Common CS Coding][Proj RCCode]|This libarary is used to provide users helper systems to make using CSharp easier to use|
|[Realms Common Text][Proj RCText]|This library is used to provide users some basic features for working with text|
|[Realms Common Systems][Proj RCSystems]|This library provides the basics for our Tools and libraries to allow for dynamic tools|

##### **Tool Libraries**

Tool Libraries are CSharp libraries which are built to provide spesific functionality to a given tool and is not meant to be used by that tool and any of its helper tools.

|Projects|Short Desc|
|:---|:---|

##### **Tool UI Libraries**

Tool UI Libraries are like Tool Libraries but provide UI and are speperate to allow for easier time when changing UI for a tool.

|Projects|Short Desc|
|:---|:---|

### Tools

Tools are CSharp applications which provide users with spesific set of runnable features. Tools are catagoried as one of 4 types:

- [Games][Sec GameTools]
- [Helper Tools][Sec HelperTools]
- [Testing Tools][Sec Testing]
- [Workbench Tools][Sec WorkbenchTool]

#### **Games**

Game Tools are well Game's they are just marked as a subtype of Tools due to sharing much of thier nature with most CSharp Tools.

|Projects|Short Desc|
|:---|:---|

#### **Helper Tools**

Helper Tools are tools that are released along side a Game Tool or a Workbench tool to provide extended functionality.

|Projects|Short Desc|
|:---|:---|

#### **Testing Tools**

Testing Tools are a tool which AMT uses to test the development of some features within libraries and tools.

|Projects|Short Desc|
|:---|:---|


#### **Workbench Tools**

Workbench tools are main tool which gets released which provides users a given type of experience.

|Projects|Short Desc|
|:---|:---|


### **Social**

AMT's Social projects are defined as any project that is used to interact with the public to provide Updates, Announcements, Releases..ECT...
