### Introduction

We at AMT use Active Seek Learning to power our staff and users to learn things not because they are being forced to like the traditional Structured General Education. While it does have a few points it works, for most the way it is done causes many to lose thier interest in learn. While Active Seek Learning promotes people into learning things because they are interested. What do we use to do this. 

AMT uses a mixture of Design Layouts to provide some basic structure to things to aid in the process of learning but also a collection of systems and features which provide many different ways to learn which allows our users to learn thier way and wanting to do so.

One of these systems, as an example, is the entire Tutorials Hub which provides public accessable access to in depth tutorials into how to user our works to power thier own works with alot less hassle.

#### Tool Requirements

Active Seek Learning does not require any tools to impliment.

#### Library Requirements

Active Seek Learning does not require any Libraries to impliment.

#### Skills Requirements

Active Seek Learning does not require any special skills to be implimented.

#### Define Active Seek Learning

Active Seek Learning involves a few concepts which work together to promote a entirely different outlook on learning. These concepts help to promote a healther mindset and a new way of life. Our goal is that through the implimentation others will see the difference and will become a chain effect on those around. 

#### Implimentation

Our Implimentation of active seek learning involves having our infomation in a place so our users and people interested can teach themselves the infomation they need, at thier own pace, which makes the thier interests show in thier own way. Our goal is to have the learning our users teach themselves will mean more then it would be with the traditinal way of learning. 

We offer a few things from [Tutorials Hub][Page LearnHome], [Projects Hub][Page ProjHome] and even our [Company Hub][Page CompanyHome] to provide our infomation.
